    <h2>Chapter 1: How It All Began</h2>
    You messaged me on Instagram replying to a story and we started talking
    You asked for my imsg
    Yk the story better than me but slowly
    Everything about my day felt incomplete without you
    I was honestly surprised by the way u typed
    In my head u typed like a paki uncle
    I loved how u spoke to me and actually showed interest in everything I said
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 2: The Things I Love About You</h2>
    I love your face and even how shy u are

    Yk when im not okay without me saying anything and it means alot
    You do things to make me feel secure and like yk idk if you get me
    I love how ambitious you are
    I love your smile
    I love how caring you are
    I love how I feel safe around you

    <h2>Chapter 5: The Future With You</h2>
    Bilal sometimes I think about our future 
    Like when we can finally be together all the time 
    When we‚Äôre settled in life and genuinely happy to have eachother 
    Like waking up next to eachother 
    Laughing over dumb things like we do now when we meet up
    Getting unlimited hugs cause we‚Äôll finally be together in the same house 
    Like getting to cuddle whilst watching beta squad or Ronaldo probably because of u 
    Everything about our future is exciting from 
    Long drives to forehead kisses to wild nights and soft days and a messy kitchen and perhaps even reckless driving 
    Like it‚Äôll be amazing 
    I imagine doing silly things with you 
    Like forcing you to make slime with me in the middle of the night üò≠üò≠
    Hopefully we work out
